Experiment 4a: Gradient Operator
  Gradient of an image without using any predefined operators like Sobel or Prewitt, you can implement a simple finite difference method.
Experiment 4b: Robert Operator
  The Roberts Cross operator is a simple and effective edge detection method that uses a pair of 2x2 convolution kernels to compute the gradient of the image intensity. The operator is particularly   sensitive to edges and is often used in image processing tasks.
